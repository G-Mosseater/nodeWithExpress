# nodeWithExpress

#  Overview

In this project, I explored different ways to work with databases in a Node.js app

## MongoDB 

- **Raw MongoDB**: Dived into the basics with the MongoDB driver — inserting, querying, and aggregating data manually to understand how it works 
- **Mongoose**: Created schemas and models with handy methods like `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, and `createOrder`. Used `populate` to link related data and `timestamps` to track when things were created or updated
- **Shopping Cart & Orders**: Built a cart system and order management, experimenting with relationships between `User`, `Product`, and `Order` collections

## SQL Exploration

- **Sequelize & Aiven**: Played around with SQL databases using Sequelize and hosted them on Aiven. Learned how relational databases differ from MongoDB

Overall, this project was about learning **different ways to structure, relate, and manage data**, and seeing how NoSQL and SQL compare in real projects

## Frontend

For the frontend, I used **EJS** instead of React since it:

- Simplifies handling sessions and dynamic views
- Easy to integrate for smaller projects
  
This setup allowed me to focus on backend logic and database operations.
